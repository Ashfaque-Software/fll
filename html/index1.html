    #1 History of HTML

     <p>user-frndly, very-lightwt,easy to lesrn, easy to intrgrt with all broswer</p>

     #3 So is HTML a programming language or not?
     <p>Think of it this way: you can’t compute the sum of 2 + 2 in HTML; that’s not what it’s for. This is
        because HTML is not a programming language</p>
      #4 HTML Elements
      <p>The three main parts of the HTML elements are:
        Opening Tag : It marks the start of the element.
        Content : The contents that is visible on the browser
        Closing Tag : It marks the end of the element. Usually it starts with a backward slash '/'</p> 
        #5 HTML Page Structure
        <p>The  <!DOCTYPE html>  declaration defines the version of HTML document, in this case it is 5
            The  <html>  element is the root element of an HTML page
            The  <head>  element contains meta information about the HTML page
            The  <title>  element specifies a title for the HTML page.
            The  <body>  element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible
            contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            The  <h1> , <h2>  element defines a headings</p>
    #6 Empty HTML Elements
    <p>HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
        The  <br>  tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:</p>
    #7 Attributes
    <p>It is basically additional features, take an example of mobile and ask attributes of mobile for
        eg: battery, camera, ram,rom etc.
         Each and every tag in HTML will have some attributes(additional features)
         Attributes can provide various types of information, such as:

Identifiers (e.g., id="header")
Classes (e.g., class="button")
        </p>
    # 8 Anchor Tag
    <p>an anchor tag connects one website to other websites using an anchor tag </p>
    #9 HTML List Tags
   <P>Lists are used quite often in websites to display a set of data or items in an ordered or unordered
    fashion.
    HTML provoides us with three types of list tags:
    Unordered List
    <ul>
        <li>apple</li>
        <li>banana</li>
    </ul>
    Ordered List
    <ol>
        <li>apple</li>
        <li>banana</li>
